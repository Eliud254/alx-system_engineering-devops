### Project Overview: Regular Expression in Ruby

In this project, the focus is on leveraging regular expressions (regex) within the Ruby programming language, using the Oniguruma library. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and manipulation of strings. They offer a concise and flexible way to define search patterns, making them invaluable for tasks such as data validation, text processing, and pattern extraction.

#### Background Context:

The project requires building and applying regular expressions using Oniguruma, the default regex library for Ruby. It's important to note that different regex libraries may have varying properties, so familiarity with the specific library in use is essential.

#### Ruby Code Example:

The provided Ruby code snippet serves as a template for the project, with the regex part marked for replacement. The objective is to create scripts that accept input arguments and apply regular expressions for pattern matching.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
```

#### Concepts Explored:

The central concept explored in this project is "Regular Expression." Regular expressions consist of patterns that describe sets of strings. In the context of Ruby, the `scan` method is used to find all occurrences of a pattern in a given string.

#### Quiz Questions:

To reinforce the understanding of regular expressions, quiz questions guide the implementation of regex patterns for specific matching criteria. Questions range from simple matching tasks to more complex scenarios involving repetition tokens, string boundaries, and character sets.

#### Resources:

The project provides a list of resources, including tutorials on basic and advanced regular expressions, the Rubular tool for testing regex patterns, and exercises for learning regular expressions interactively.

#### Requirements and Tasks:

The project outlines requirements for scripts, including the use of specific editors, adherence to coding standards, and the creation of an executable README.md file. Tasks involve developing Ruby scripts for various regex matching scenarios, with each task building on the complexity of the previous one.

#### Summary:

Regular expressions are a fundamental tool in a programmer's toolkit, enabling efficient and expressive string manipulation. This project equips participants with the skills to construct and apply regex patterns in the context of Ruby programming, providing valuable insights into the practical use of regular expressions for solving real-world problems.
