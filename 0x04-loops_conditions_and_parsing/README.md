## Project Description

This project is part of the DevOps curriculum and focuses on loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting. The tasks cover various concepts such as SSH key pair creation, loop structures (for, while, until), conditional statements (if, else, elif, case), file operations, and more.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to:

- Create SSH key pairs.
- Understand the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- Use while, until, and for loops in Bash scripts.
- Implement if, else, elif, and case condition statements.
- Utilize the `cut` command and comparison operators.
- Handle files and other comparison operators.
- Write portable scripts and ensure they pass Shellcheck.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Files should end with a new line
- A README.md file is mandatory
- Bash script files must be executable
- Not allowed to use awk
- Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose

## Tasks

### Task 0: Create a SSH RSA key pair

- Read [Linux and Mac OS users](#) or [Windows users](#) for instructions.
- Use `ssh-keygen` to create an RSA key pair.
- Share the public key (`0-RSA_public_key.pub`) and update your intranet profile.
- Keep the private key secure for future use.

### Task 1: For Best School loop

- Write a Bash script using a `for` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

### Task 2: While Best School loop

- Write a Bash script using a `while` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

### Task 3: Until Best School loop

- Write a Bash script using an `until` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

### Task 4: If 9, say Hi!

- Write a Bash script using a `while` loop and an `if` statement to display "Hi" on the 9th iteration.

### Task 5: 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance

- Write a Bash script using a `while` loop and `if`, `elif`, `else` statements to display different messages for specific iterations.

### Task 6: Superstitious numbers

- Write a Bash script using a `while` loop and a `case` statement to display messages for specific loop iterations.

### Task 7: Clock

- Write a Bash script using a `while` loop to display the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes.

### Task 8: For ls

- Write a Bash script using a `for` loop to list the content of the current directory.

### Task 9: To file, or not to file

- Write a Bash script using `if` and `else` statements to check and display information about a file.

### Task 10: FizzBuzz

- Write a Bash script using a `for` loop to display numbers from 1 to 100, applying specific rules for certain numbers.
