# 0x0B. SSH Project

## Overview

Welcome to the 0x0B. SSH Project, part of the DevOps, Network, SysAdmin, and Security curriculum. This project, led by Sylvain Kalache, is designed to enhance your understanding of SSH (Secure Shell), servers, and key authentication. Please ensure to adhere to the guidelines to maximize your learning experience.

## Background Context

In this project, you'll be working with an Ubuntu server located in a datacenter. Unlike the previous level, you'll connect using SSH with an RSA key. The server is pre-configured with the public key generated in the initial task of a prior project. Details, including server information, can be found in the "My Servers" section of the intranet.

**Server Information:**
- **Name:** 11480-web-01
- **Username:** ubuntu
- **IP:** 54.160.120.57
- **State:** Running
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
