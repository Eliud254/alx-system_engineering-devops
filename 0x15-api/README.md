                 API

Project Description
The API project is designed to explore the capabilities of Python in working with REST APIs. It focuses on gathering and processing data from an external API source. The goal is to demonstrate best practices in Python scripting and highlight the importance of APIs in modern system administration and software engineering.

Background Context
Old-school system administrators typically use Bash scripting for various tasks. However, the new generation of system administrators, often known as Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), are more proficient in multiple programming languages. APIs play a crucial role in exposing applications and datasets, allowing external interaction. In this project, Python scripts will be developed to access employee data via an API, organize the information, and export it into different data structures.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will gain knowledge in:

Understanding the limitations of Bash scripting.
Exploring what an API is and its significance.
Understanding REST APIs and microservices.
Learning about data formats such as CSV and JSON.
Adhering to Pythonic coding styles and naming conventions.
